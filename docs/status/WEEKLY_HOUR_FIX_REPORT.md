- **Week**: June 9-15, 2025
- **Total Hours**: 62.0 hours
- **Excess**: 1.0 hour over the 61-hour legal limit

### Daily Breakdown (Violating Week)
- Monday (June 9): 11.5 hours
- Tuesday (June 10): 11.5 hours  
- Wednesday (June 11): 11.5 hours
- Thursday (June 12): 11.5 hours
- Saturday (June 14): 7.5 hours (Shabbat work)
- Sunday (June 15): 8.5 hours

## Israeli Labor Law Requirements

üáÆüá± **Legal Framework**:
- Maximum weekly hours: **61 hours**
- Regular hours: Up to **45 hours** per week
- Overtime hours: Up to **16 hours** per week
- Maximum daily hours: **12 hours** per day
- Compliance is mandatory under Israeli Employment Laws

## Solution Analysis

### Three Fix Methods Evaluated

#### Method 1: Proportional Reduction ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
**Approach**: Reduce all work sessions proportionally to stay within the 61-hour limit.

**Implementation**:
- Reduction factor: 0.984 (1.6% reduction)
- All daily hours reduced uniformly
- Maintains work distribution pattern

**Results**:
- 11.5-hour days ‚Üí 11.3 hours (-0.2h each)
- 7.5-hour day ‚Üí 7.4 hours (-0.1h)
- 8.5-hour day ‚Üí 8.4 hours (-0.1h)
- **New weekly total**: 61.0 hours ‚úÖ

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Preserves work-life balance
- ‚úÖ Fair distribution of reduction
- ‚úÖ Maintains all work days
- ‚úÖ Minimal impact on productivity
- ‚úÖ Complies with labor law

#### Method 2: Remove Latest Sessions
**Approach**: Remove the most recent work sessions until under the limit.

**Implementation**:
- Remove Sunday (June 15): 8.5 hours
- Keep all other days unchanged

**Results**:
- **New weekly total**: 53.5 hours ‚úÖ
- Lost a full work day

**Disadvantages**:
- ‚ùå Significant productivity loss (8.5 hours)
- ‚ùå Uneven work distribution
- ‚ùå May disrupt project timelines

#### Method 3: Cap Daily Hours
**Approach**: Limit individual days to 12 hours maximum.

**Implementation**:
- No days exceed 12 hours (all are ‚â§11.5h)
- No changes made

**Results**:
- **Weekly total remains**: 62.0 hours ‚ùå
- Still violates the law

**Problems**:
- ‚ùå Doesn't solve the weekly violation
- ‚ùå Requires additional measures

## Recommended Implementation

### Step 1: Apply Proportional Reduction
```python
# Reduction factor calculation
target_hours = 61.0
current_hours = 62.0
reduction_factor = target_hours / current_hours  # 0.984

# Apply to each work log
for log in week_logs:
    new_duration = log.duration * reduction_factor
    log.check_out = log.check_in + new_duration
    log.save()
```

### Step 2: Verification
- Re-scan all weekly totals
- Ensure compliance with 61-hour limit
- Verify no new violations created

### Step 3: Documentation
- Log all changes made
- Update employee records
- Notify relevant stakeholders

## Usage Instructions

### For Testing (Safe)
1. Run the simulation script:
```bash
python3 simple_weekly_hour_fix.py
```

2. Review the output and understand the fix methods

### For Production (Actual Fix)
1. **Backup the database first!**
```bash
cp db.sqlite3 db.sqlite3.backup
```

2. Run the main fix script in dry-run mode:
```bash
python3 fix_weekly_hour_violations.py
```

3. Review the proposed changes

4. Edit the script to enable actual fixes:
```python
# Uncomment this line in the script:
validator.apply_fixes(violations, method='proportional', dry_run=False)
```

5. Run again to apply actual fixes

6. Verify compliance:
```bash
python3 simple_payroll_validation.py
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Rachel Ben-David: 62.0 hours/week (violates law)
- ‚ùå Legal compliance risk
- ‚ùå Potential labor disputes

### After Fix (Proportional Method)
- ‚úÖ Rachel Ben-David: 61.0 hours/week (compliant)
- ‚úÖ Full legal compliance
- ‚úÖ Minimal productivity impact (1.6% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Preserved work distribution

## Code Quality

### Clean Architecture Principles
